### **About mySelf:**

*The reason why I started learning programming is pretty simple.
First of all, it's not a secret, that almost everything is built
using one or another programming language. You want to order food - 
you should use application written by programmers. You want to check, how 
much likes you got under post, ypu log in in to the application that was written
by programmers - **instagram**. I decided to create, but not just be a simple 
user. I began my looong joyrney with language such as ***JavaScript***.*But, after
that I want to learn backend, ***Java***. *At the moment I study on Udemy.
I bought 2 lessons from 2 different teachers, so I can get more information
as it possible. I like the idea of RSS. I like the way how you give the info,
your community. It is very important to have a community, where you can ask 
for a help and give your advice to beginners. I know, that programming
is hard, but what I know better, that it is very interesting and woth the time.
P.S. Thank you for such opportunity.*
